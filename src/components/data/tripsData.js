So here on this trip to Himachal Pradesh we are taking you to a less explored village of Parvati valley where you will be staying in pure wooden Homestay. This place has no Traffic because it is not connected to the roads, so we will hike 15 min to reach our homestay. Staying here is a very basic wooden house but the valley view & food will really make you fall in love with this village. we have done this stay with more than 500+ participants hand all of them have been rated this village 10 on"

Immerse yourself in the natural bounties surrounding you. The wait is over, from the base camp the next day we trek to Kedarkantha summit. The trail is difficult because you have to walk on the snow. However, the joy of walking on snow is inexplicable. At the summit, you will be rewarded with awe-inspiring views of Yamunotri and Gangotri ranges and also of Kinner Kailash range and other ranges in Himachal."
